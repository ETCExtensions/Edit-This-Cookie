EditThisCookie
========================

Description
--------------

EditThisCookie is a cookie manager. You can add, delete, edit, search, protect, and block cookies!
Inspired by the lack of good cookie managers in Google Chrome, I developed this small, simple, and extremely useful extension that allows you to do anything you'll ever need to do to cookies!

* Delete any cookie
* Edit any cookie
* Add a new cookie
* Search a cookie
* Protect a cookie (read-only)
* Block cookies (cookie filter)
* Export cookies in JSON, Netscape cookie file (perfect for wget and curl), Perl::LPW
* Import cookies in JSON
* Limit the maximum expiration date of any cookie
